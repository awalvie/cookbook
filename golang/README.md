# Golang Notes

- Outside a function, every statement begins with a keyword (var, func, and so on) and so the `:=` construct is not available.
- The zero value is:
	```go
	0 for numeric types,
	false for the boolean type, and
	"" (the empty string) for strings.
	```
- Constants cannot be declared with `:=` either.
